# Portfolio-Optimization : Impact of News and Public Sentiments to a Novice Investment Portfolio
Judah Odiachi

# Abstract
In recent times, we saw the frenzy associated with stocks such as Gamestop, AMC, Nokia surging
for a short period early in 2021 due to news and public sentiments surrounding the stocks. A lot
of amateur traders who saw this as an opportunity to make a high return on investments timed
the market wrong and suffered losses. This project aims to study these stocks before their surge
and during the price surge to validate whether these are good stocks to be included in a portfolio.
To achieve this objective, the closing price of the selected stocks and cryptocurrencies are
evaluated using the moving average (MA) technique and relative strength index (RSI) to
determine position signals. i.e., when to buy (long) or sell (short) a stock. The stock performance
of the selected commodities is compared with market returns, making comparisons with the S&P
500. Finally, these stocks are placed in a portfolio, mimicking the behavior of novice investors.
The portfolio is optimized from the basis of Markowitz's Theory to determine the optimum
weights to be assigned to the assets to maximize the expected returns. This project shows how
news and public sentiments could be detrimental in selecting assets that should be included in a
portfolio.
